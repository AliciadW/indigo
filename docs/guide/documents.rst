Searching
.........

Search for a document by typing in the search box. This will limit the documents to only those that match your search. Searches ignore case and
match against title, year and number. Clear the search by clicking the ``x`` button.


Filtering by Country
....................

To show only documents for a particular country click the name of the country in the list on the right.


Filtering by Tag
................

Tags are a powerful way to group and manage documents however you need to. You can add as many tags as you like to a document.

Change a document's tags by clicking on the document name and changing them in the ``Basic details`` section of the properties
page.

You can filter the documents to show only those with one or more tags. To do so, click the tag in the list of tags on the right.
The number next to the tag is the number of documents that have that tag. Tags you are filtering by are highlighted in blue.

If you choose to filter by multiple tags, only documents with all of the chosen tags will be shown.


Importing a new document
------------------------

.. note::

    Useful tips before importing a document:

    - Remove the Table of Contents
    - Prefer RTF or Word (.doc) documents, use PDFs as a last resort
