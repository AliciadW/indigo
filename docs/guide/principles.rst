Indigo Principles
=================

The Indigo platform works a bit different to other consolidation platforms you might be familiar with. Here we describe
these differences and why they exist.  Understanding these differences will
help make explain why the Indigo platform doesn't look like a text editor such
as Microsoft Word.

.. note::

    Throughout this guide we refer to **documents**. These are generally legislative Acts but may also be related
    legislative documents such as regulations or by-laws.



Structure, Content and Presentation 
-----------------------------------

A key goal of the Indigo platform is to allow content to be published for a wide variety of media and devices, including print, desktop web browsers, mobile phones and others that we don't yet know of. It's important that a document can be formatted appropriately for each medium. For example, a printed document will include the Table of Contents at the start of the document, while a web browser and a mobile phone will display the Table of Contents differently to help users navigate the document effectively.

To achieve this, the platform must capture the **metadata**, **content** and **structure** of the document separately from its **presentation**.

- The **metadata** describes the document as a piece of work and includes information such as its title, publication date, language and country. This data allows users to classify, browse and search for documents and is also used when presenting the document.
- The **content** is the actual words of the document, including headings, tables and paragraph numbers, and forms the core of the document.
- The **structure** is the heirarchy of the document, including chapter, part and section information. Capturing the structure makes it possible to provide intuitive user experiences, such as an interface for browsing through a document by section or linking between different sections of a document or between documents.
- The **presentation** is how the document is physically presented to the user and includes typography, layout, colour and formatting.

Notice that presentation is separate from structure and comes *last* in the logical pipeline of managing a document. The same metadata, content and structure can be presented in many different ways.

.. note::

    It's more important to capture the **content** and **structure** of a document than match the presentation of the original exactly.
